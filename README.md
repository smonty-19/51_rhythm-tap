# Rhythm Tap

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Tasks to Complete

### Task 1: Sound Effects on Hit

### Task 2: Hold Notes
> Add a long note type that the player must hold for 1 second to score.



### Task 3: BPM-Synced Spawning
> Notes should spawn on exact beats of a given BPM (e.g., 120 BPM) instead of a timer.


### Task 4: Grade Summary Screen
